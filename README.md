# DevTycoon 

A fun Play-to-earn game that mimics the daily life of a developer in a fun way. Optimize your Assets usage and minimize your liability to become the ultimate Billionaire.
 
# Brainstorm 🤔

We wanted to build something retro styled and something that would benefit NGO’s and NPO’s to spread awareness as Play to Earn games are becoming popular. It is necessary to build a game that is fun to play and spreads awareness about Environmental and Health issues. To mix our Retro Theme + Play to Earn + Awareness Campaign. What if we can give the terminal experience to everyone and spread social awareness about various campaigns with an incentive. So we decided to build DevTycoon. 
TLDR;
Play to Earn + Retro + Social Awareness   (What else can you ask for ?)
 

# Gameplay 🎮

DevTycoon is a truly Decentralized Play to Earn Games where users have to manage   multiple resources and maximize their gains. Dev Tycoon is an Economy-Strategy-Time Simulation game where every decision you make can lead you to a different direction. The plot of the game is that you are a Freelance Developer and you will be offered various projects with different hardware/software/physical requirements with a reward. You have to carefully evaluate the project and accept or reject it. 
TLDR ; Strategy-Economy-Time Simulation Game
May the Best Strategy Win


# Spreading Awareness 🎗️

We feel that it is our duty to spread Social/Mental/Environmental awareness to Everyone. There are many wonderful campaigns which deserve more love and attention. Many Charities and Non-Profit organizations are trying to reach an audience and we feel giving people an incentive and fun experience while also spreading awareness is the best solution to reach millions of people. Initially we will handpick some wonderful campaigns but over the time make our selection process more decentralized using our work token as governance.

# How to Play ? 😵

The game is played by searching for jobs every job you get is randomly generated via smart contracts on Metis L2 chain (no cheating). Every job has certain requirements which you must be able to fulfill. This requirements can be fulfilled via 3 Tokens which can be bought/sold via DEX.
Coffee Token (ERC20)
Energy Token (ERC20)
Chocolate Token (ERC20)
After you have fulfilled the requirements you can take the job. Every job has a specific amount of blocktime and rewards associated with it. You will then have to watch Social/Health/Charity Awareness Videos till that time.
Now you can claim the Reward. The rewards are paid out as Work token which is the main currency of the game which you can use to Upgrade your computer and receive NFT’s. You can also buy Coffee/Energy/Chocolate tokens with Work Token.
The game mechanics are so complex that a single smart contract could not be used. We had to use 5 separate smart contracts instead.
One for the backbone token (called WK (work)) of the economy.
One for each of the TNT20 tokens which are fungible in-game resources
And one for handling all the in-game transactions and game-logic.


# Infrastructure 🏗

We want to make our infrastructure as decentralized as possible. We have architectured the platform in a decentralized way.
IPFS Video Storage : Every Video of the awareness campaigns are uploaded to IPFS so we can immediately support metis-ipfs in future.

Metis L2 Smart Contract : The smart contracts are the heart of our platform providing all the in game logic and rewarding system they make our game transparent,speedy and decentralized

Graph Node : A self-hosted graph node is ran by us to provide indexed data to the frontend minimizing rpc calls and providing smoother experience to users. Our graph node is completely open and anyone can deploy there graph on it. 


# Challenges we ran into 💪

Thinking of a dynamic game mechanism to align the interest of users as well as our core values
Managing Deadlines 
There is very less information available about indexing metis chain
Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
Creating a game which spreads awareness and is fun to play. We ourself have played it for hours !
Deploying our own graph node 
Deploying so many smart contracts


# What's next for DevTycoon 🥚
We are planning to integrate the smart contract with the chain link price feeder by running our own chain link node to maintain a synchronous system of reward that takes into account the current price  of the reward token to reward more appropriately. Engaging with some Non-Profits to spread and create videos about there campaigns
